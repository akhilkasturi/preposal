# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I am a semi-pro in a game called SMITE, and I want to make a python tool for the game that will allow for a team to relay and organize information more easily. I do not have one large idea in mind, but rather a couple of smaller projects that have practical uses in the game that I want to culminate into improvement from making little things easier. Some examples of ideas I had require some basic understanding of the game, so I will give a general explanation: Smite is a MOBA, there are two teams of 5 players, who each select a unique character, and the objective of the game is to kill the boss in the enemy team's base (called a titan). In order to get stronger, you have to kill minions and jungle camps in order to get gold and experience to buy items and level up.
Idea 1: Smite relic timer: Relics are important items in smite that go on cooldown after use. They are very powerful, so in competitive games, people often try to fight the other team when their relics are on cooldown. This part of the project would allow the user to input any relic, and the time in game that it was used, and it will return the time that the relic will be off of cooldown. The benefit of this is having a specific time frame in mind where you know you are stronger than the enemy.
Idea 2: Damage calculator: Each character in smite has four unique abilities that do different things. Each ability has base damage, which it does regardless of if any items are purchased, and additional damage called "scaling", which is derived from how much power is in the items you have bought. When you buy an item, it will give you a certain amount of useful stats, such as power, defense, etc. I want to create a program that you can input how much power you have, how much defense the enemy has, and then it will basically give you a summary of how many abilities you need to hit to kill the enemy.
## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

N/A

## Do you have any questions of your own?

One question I had about this project is how I would demonstrate what the code that I write does, since it requires some basic knowledge of the game. I think the best way to go about it would be giving a small description about what it is doing in the context of the game and why that is important.
